## About Us

Welcome to Divorced Coders, where precision meets prediction in the dynamic world of stock analysis. We are passionate about empowering investors with innovative tools and insights to make informed decisions in the ever-evolving financial markets.

### Our Mission

At Divorced Coders, our mission is to provide cutting-edge stock analysis that goes beyond traditional methods. We combine the power of the Fibonacci sequence and advanced sorting techniques to offer a unique and insightful approach to understanding market trends. Our goal is to help both seasoned investors and newcomers navigate the complexities of the stock market with confidence.

### The Fibonacci Advantage

We believe in harnessing the timeless wisdom of the Fibonacci sequence, a mathematical concept that has proven its significance across various disciplines. In the context of stock analysis, we leverage Fibonacci retracement levels to identify potential turning points in stock prices. This strategic application allows us to uncover hidden patterns and anticipate market movements with a higher degree of accuracy.

### Sorting for Success

In addition to Fibonacci analysis, we employ sophisticated sorting algorithms to sift through vast amounts of financial data. Our advanced sorting methods enable us to extract meaningful insights, identify correlations, and highlight trends that might be overlooked by conventional approaches. This commitment to detail ensures that our users receive comprehensive and reliable information for making informed investment decisions.
